                <h2>The Nature of Weaponized Misinformation</h2>
                <p>
                    Weaponized misinformation frequently targets certain groups or organizations in order to exploit vulnerabilities, such as political divisiveness or mistrust of established media. It is intended to elicit emotional responses, widen disparities, and affect behavior. These techniques are used by both state and non-state actors, including as governments, extremist organizations, and opportunistic individuals, to destabilize countries and advance objectives.

These tools are used to impersonate public figures, fabricate news, or misrepresent events <br>Psychological Exploitation: Weaponized misinformation exploits cognitive biases like confirmation bias or fear, making people more inclined to accept and spread incorrect information. Emotionally sensitive themes including health, security, and identity are popular targets.</p>
